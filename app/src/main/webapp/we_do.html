                <p>After you answer a survey to have a basic profile diagnosis, we provide those answers to the
                    doctors and therapists who have decided to treat patients with similar profiles as yours.
                    After one of them accepts to be your designated health worker, you can scheduele a video call
                    or simply have a one on one text chat with your therapist.

                    therapist. This group will serve as a support group for you and for the other memebers just like you.

                <h2>We keep your data safe and private</h2>
                <p>The only time your data is in a server is when answering the initial survey, Afterwards, we delete your answers
                    and all data provided to your doctor or therapist is only sent to your doctor or therapist. We don't hold it in
                    a server. We believe that your medical data should be private and only shared to those you want to share it with.
                    This is also to prevent it from being malliciously used by any third party intermedium. In other words, your data
                    is your data.

                <h2>We do it all for free</h2>
                <p>We believe that anyone deserves to be heard, deserves to love themselves and deserve to have a healthy, happy life.
                    These are trying times for everyone, not everyone who needs or deserves this kind of treatment can afford it. That's
                    why we decided to make this as affordable as can be: $0.00 USD. Mental health should be a right, and that's what we
                    want to provide, that is what we do. We give you the right to free mental health assistance.
