                    <h2>Mental Health is a right, not a privilege </h2>
                    <p>We believe that this is one of the many steps forward in making mental health a right. Article
                        25 of the Universal Declaration of Human rights already establishes that everyone has the right to
                        health and well being, but psychiatry and psychology are stil very expensive in developed
                        and developing countries. We envision a future where everyone can truly live their right to mental health.

                    <h2>A World of Emotional Responsibility and Maturity</h2>
                    <p>We hope to live in a world where every adult has more control over how the handle and express their
                        emotions. People need to understand that everyone can feel different things, and expressing feelings of
                        joy, sadness, anger, envy, and every other emotion on the specter. It's not about what emotions you feel,
                        but how you deal with them that matters. This is our vision, our creed.
