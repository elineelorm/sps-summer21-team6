                    <h2>It's okay to ask for help</h2>
                    <p>For many cultures around the world, there exists this idea or fear of seeking for help, of reaching out for
                        therapy or going to a psychiatrist. We aim to erase that idea with this innovative and deiscreet form of 
                        help. By eleminating this societal fear, we believe society will change for the better and people can grow
                        to become their best self in a more encouraging life space.

                    <p>We belieivie that offering this kind of online therapy will change the way we view the medical industry, by
                        offering quality service online. Many have tried but they fail to see the potnetial of online therapy and as
                        such, they don't take advantage of what the Internet is capable of. We aim to change this, disrupt the way
                        we view the Internet and the way it can change people's life for the better.
